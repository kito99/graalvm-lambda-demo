# graalvm-lambda-demo

Hello world app deployed as an AWS Lambda as a fat Java JAR and also as a [GraalVM native image](https://www.graalvm.org/22.2/docs/getting-started/#native-image) using the AWS CDK. Useful for 
comparing building/deploying native vs pure Java on Lambdas.

This demo was derived from:

## Pre-requisites:

In order to build this project, you must have the following installed:

* Maven 3.6.3
* [GraalVM 22.0.0.2](https://www.graalvm.org/22.2/docs/getting-started/#install-graalvm) with [native image tool](https://www.graalvm.org/22.2/docs/getting-started/#native-image)
* [AWS CDK CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cli.html)
** If you don't have your credentials configured, an easy way to do it is to [install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html](configure them through the `aws` command).
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Building and deploying

Building and deployment is a two-step process:

1. Build the Java JAR

```bash
cd function
mvn clean package
```

2. Deploy to AWS Lambda

> TIP: Make sure Docker Desktop is running before deploying.

> NOTE: Currently this project is set to build using an ARM Docker image and deploy to 
> [Lambda ARM architecture](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/foundation-arch.html#foundation-arch-adv)
> (which is cheaper). To change to x86, edit [InfrastructureStack.java](infra/src/main/java/virtua/demo/graalvm/lambda/InfrastructureStack.java).

The follow command does the following:
   1. Deploy the Java JAR using the AWS Java 11 Runtime
   2. Build a native image in an Amazon Linux Docker container and deploy a ZIP using an Amazon Linux custom runtime

```bash
cd infra
cdk deploy
```

> NOTE: If the deployment fails, use `cdk --debug deploy` to get some more info about the root cause.

After deployment is complete, each deployment outputs a URL you can use for testing:

```bash
Outputs:
GraalVmLambdaDemoStack.HelloWorldGraalApiUrl = https://bchs2cynrg.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hello-world-graal
GraalVmLambdaDemoStack.HelloWorldJvmApiUrl = https://bchs2cynrg.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hello-world-jvm
```

And you can use `curl` (or your browser) to test:

```bash
$ curl https://bchs2cynrg.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hello-world-jvm
Hello world!
$ curl https://bchs2cynrg.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hello-world-graal
Hello world!
```

If you log into the AWS Console, you'll be able to find the following artifacts:

* CloudFormation Stack: GraalVmLambdaDemoStack
* Lambda: GraalVmLambdaDemoStack-HelloWorldFunctionGraalVm<id>
* Lambda: GraalVmLambdaDemoStack-HelloWorldFunctionJvm<id>
* Lambda: GraalVmLambdaDemoStack-LogRetentiona<id>
* API Gateway Route: GraalVmLambdaDemoApi
  * Route: /hello-world-graal
  * Route: /hello-world-jvm

To see how these are configured, look at [InfrastructureStack.java](infra/src/main/java/virtua/demo/graalvm/lambda/InfrastructureStack.java).

## Performance

You can find performance info in the AWS Console; the easiest way is to view the Lambda function, Monitor -> Logs and 
expand the request:

In general, you can expect the native image to have a faster cold start time, a faster response time, and lower memory utilization.
